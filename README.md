pywinauto-64bit
===============

This is the same as pywinauto-0.4.0 but with some ASSERT instructions removed for 64-bit compatibility. 

I'm not sure about the original author's idea for having those ASSERTs, and whether removing them can cause unexpected behaviour, but preliminary testing shows that this works.
